## CMSC335 Final Project: Video Game Review Blog Website

### Team Members: 
Anirudh Poruri (aporuri), Karthick Sankar (ksankar1), Malchu Pascual (mpascual)

### Description:
This website lets users create reviews of video games, inputting the information onto a form and posting them in a blog format. 
Using MongoDB as our database, we are able to display **all** the reviews created by users. There's also a Pokemon page where 
users can enter a Pokemon name and get the Pokemon's type, using PokeAPI.

### API:
We use the PokeAPI in this project to fetch data about a Pokemon that the user enters. Here is the link to the API: https://pokeapi.co/
